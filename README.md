## About Me 👨‍💻

I'm a passionate **Systems Development Technician** and a **Computer Science student** at UNIFESP. My tech journey started in 2018 during a visit to a Microsoft office in São Paulo, where I witnessed how technology transforms ideas into impactful solutions.

With a strong foundation in system development and ongoing academic training, I am dedicated to building efficient, practical, and innovative software solutions.
